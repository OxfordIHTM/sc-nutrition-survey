Nutrition surveys provide the information from which to assess the nutritional status of a population. This document provides guidance on specific aspects of conducting nutrition surveys. Chapter 2 to 7 focus on the various anthropometric measurements performed during nutrition surveys. [Chapter 2](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/anthro.html) first describes two forms of undernutrition - acute undernutrition and chronic undernutrition - and then explains each including the signs and symptoms associated and the anthropometric indices used to diagnose them. [Chapter 3](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/weight.html), [Chapter 4](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/height.html), [Chapter 5](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/muac.html), and [Chapter 6](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/oedema.html) describes the equipment needed, the personnel required and the steps to undertake in performing weight, height, MUAC and oedema measurements respectively. [Chapter 7](https://nutriverse.validmeasures.org/nutrisurvey/standard.html) then discusses how survey personnel can be assessed as to their abilities to perform the various anthropometric measurements through a standardisation test.
