# Measuring height {#height}

## Equipment

A height board, sometimes called a heightometer or stadiometer, is the tool used to measure height of children. It is usually constructed based on a ruler with a sliding horizontal headpiece which adjusts to rest on top of the head. Some common types of height boards are the wooden 2-piece and wooden 3-piece, plastic free-standing, aluminum free-standing and locally-produced boards. Of these, it is preferable to use wooden measuring boards as opposed to aluminum boards which can get very hot in the sun and burn children. The measuring board should be at least 130 cm long and made of hardwood with a hard water-resistant finish. Choice of woods is important. The board should be light enough to be easily carried in the field from house to house. The board should have two tape measures attached to it, one on each side, and they should be marked out in 0.1cm increments. The board should be easily set upright to measure height with the head piece of the length board becoming the base when the board is set upright.

```{r fig.cap = "Vertical 2-piece height board", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.retina = 1}

```

```{r fig.cap = "Recumbent 2-piece height board", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.retina = 1}

```

```{r fig.cap = "2-piece height board folded and carried", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.retina = 1}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shorrBrdcarry.jpg")
```

## Personnel

A minimum of two personnel are needed to measure the height or length of a child. If human resources are not an issue, a three-person team would be ideal especially when taking the length of the child. For a two-person team, one is assigned as the **measurer** while the other is assigned as the **assistant**. It is important that prior to the measurement of the height of a child that these roles are clearly specified and that each personnel knows what their role entails. Switching roles between measurement of different children is acceptable for as long as all personnel are trained on performing the tasks expected of either **measurer** or **assistant**. For specific tasks for each role, see next section.

## Steps in measuring length or height of child

Depending on the age of the child, either the weight or the length is measured. For children less than 24 months old (or for height less than 85 cms), length should be measured i.e., height board on recumbent position with the child lying down.  For children 24 months and older, height should be measured i.e., height board on the vertical position with the child standing up.

### Measuring height

```{r fig.cap = "Steps in measuring height", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.retina = 1}

```

1. **Measurer** or **Assistant** should place the measuring board on a hard flat surface against a wall, table, tree, staircase, etc.  Make sure the board is stable.

2.	**Measurer** or **Assistant** should ask the mother to remove the child's shoes and unbraid any hair that would interfere with the height measurement. Ask mother to walk the child to the board and to kneel in front of the child.

3. 	**Assistant** should place the paper questionnaire or mobile device on the ground (`arrow 1`) and kneel with both knees on the right side of the child (`arrow 2`). 

4. **Measurer** should kneel on their right knee only, for maximum  mobility, on the child's left side  (`arrow 3`).

5.	**Assistant** should place the child's feet flat and together in the centre of and against the back and base of the board. The assistant should place right hand just above the child's ankles on the shins (`arrow 4`) with left hand on the child's knees (`arrow 5`) and push against the board making sure the child's legs are straight and the heels and calves are against the board (`arrows 6` and `7`).  The **assistant** then notifies the measurer when positioning of the feet and legs is complete.

6.	**Measurer** tells the child to look straight ahead at the mother if she is in front of the child.  Make sure the child's line of sight is level with the ground (`arrow 8`). **Measurer** places open left hand on the child's chin and gradually closes hand (`arrow 9`) taking care that the child's mouth or ears are not covered. The **measurer** makes sure the shoulders are level (`arrow 10`), the hands are at the child's side (`arrow 11`), and the head, shoulder blades and buttocks are against the board (`arrows 12`,`13` and `14`). With the right hand, the **measurer** lowers the headpiece on top of the child's head making sure that the headpiece pushes through the child's hair (`arrow 15`).

7.	**Measurer** and **Assistant** should check the child's position (`arrow 1-15`) and repeating any steps necessary.

8. When the child's position is correct, the **measurer** reads and calls out the measurement to the nearest 0.1cm.  Then, the **measurer** removes the headpiece from the child's head and releases the left hand from the child's chin and supports the child during the recording.

9.	**Assistant** immediately records the measurement and shows it to the **measurer**.

10.	**Measurer** checks the recorded measurement on the questionnaire for accuracy and legibility and instructs the **assistant** to erase and correct any errors.

### Measuring length

```{r fig.cap = "Steps in measuring length", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.retina = 1}
knitr::include_graphics("images/length.png")
```

1. **Measurer** or **assistant** places the measuring board on a hard flat surface, such as the ground, floor or a steady table.

2.	**Assistant** places the paper questionnaire or the mobile device on the ground, floor or table (`arrow 1`) and kneels with both knees behind the base of the board, if it is on the ground or floor (`arrow 2`).

3	**Measurer** kneels on the child's right side so that you can hold the footpiece with your right hand (Arrow 3). 
(4)	Measurer and assistant: With the mother's/caretaker's help, lay the child on the board by doing the following: 
Assistant: Support the back of the child's head with your hands and gradually lower the child onto the board. 
Measurer: Support the child at the trunk of the body. 
(5)	Measurer or assistant: Ask the mother/caretaker to kneel on the opposite side of the board facing the measurer to help keep the child calm. 
(6)	Assistant: Cup your hands over the child's ears (Arrow 4). With your arms comfortably straight (Arrow 5), place the child's head against the base of the board so that the child is looking straight up. The child's line of sight should be perpendicular to the ground (Arrow 6). Your head should be straight over the child's head. Look directly into the child's eyes. 
(7)	Measurer: Make sure the child is lying flat and in the centre of the board (Arrow 7). Place your left hand on the child's shins (above the ankles) or on the knees (Arrow 8). Press them firmly against the board. With your right hand, place the footpiece firmly against the child's heels (Arrow 9). 
(8)	Measurer and assistant: Check the child's position (Arrows 4-9). Repeat any steps as necessary. 
(9)	Measurer: When the child's position is correct, read and call out the measurement to the nearest 0.1 centimetre. Remove the footpiece, release your left hand from the child's shins or knees and support the child during the recording. 
(10)	Assistant: Immediately release the child's head, record the measurement in AN4 and show it to the measurer. Alternatively, the assistant could call out the measurement and have the measurer confirm by repeating back.
(11)	Assistant: Record in AN4A whether the child was measured lying down or standing up.
(12)	Measurer: Check the recorded measurement on the questionnaire for accuracy and legibility. Instruct the assistant to cancel and correct any errors. 

NOTE:
If the interviewer is not confident in the precision of the child's age (under age 2), please take measurement as described above. If the child's length is measured to 85 cm or more, you must instead measure the child's height.
