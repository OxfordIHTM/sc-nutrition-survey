This chapter discusses the various forms of childhood undernutrition, describes the indices used to diagnose them and the anthropometric measurements performed that will provide data to calculate the various indices. 2.1 Forms of childhood undernutrition Childhood undernutrition manifests in various forms. It is important to note the use of the term undernutrition rather than malnutrition as this guide will not touch upon overweight and obesity. In this guide, the focus will be on two forms of undernutrition: 1) acute undernutrition; and, 2) chronic undernutrition. Childhood undernutrition manifested as micronutrient deficiencies will not be discussed. 2.1.1 Acute undernutrition Childhood acute undernutrition is a condition related to a child’s acute inadequate nutrition leading to rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight normally. Situations such as acute shortage of food and/or acute episodes of childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and/or malaria can bring about this rapid weight loss or weight gain failure in children. A. Physical signs and symptoms Acute undernutrition in a child can manifest in two ways. Marasmus: This condition is also called wasting given that a child suffering from it presents as wasted with an appearance of “skin and bones” because of excessive thinness that is due to rapid loss of muscle and fatty tissue. Other physical features include the child’s face looking like an old man’s (old man facies due to loss of facial subcutaneous fat), child’s rib cage is easily visible and skin folds on buttocks and thighs appearing like “baggy pants”. Kwashiorkor: Some children with acute undernutrition develop nutritional oedema. Oedema is an accumulation of fluid in the tissue, especially the feet and legs and nutritional oedema is specifically characterised as being bilateral and pitting. The child with kwashiorkor is withdrawn, irritable, obviously ill and will not eat. The hair is thin, sparse and sometimes discoloured. The skin has symmetrical discoloured patches where the skin later cracks and peels off. Figure 2.1: Child with bilateral oedema, skin and hair changes Figure 2.1: Bilateral pitting oedema B. Anthropometric indices The physical signs and symptoms of acute undernutrition described above are considered pathognomonic of the condition i.e., if these signs and symptoms are found in a child, it is very likley that the child has acute undernutrition. However, other than physical signs, there are anthropometric indices used to diagnose acute undernutrition in children. Weight-for-height/weight-for-length The first independent criteria for marasmus or wasting is weight-for-height (WFH)/weight-for-length (WFL). Given child A, this child’s weight is assessed against the mean weight of a standard group of children in good health with the same height or length as child A (length is measured when the child is &lt; 85 cms in height or &lt; 24 months old). Child A is expected to have a weight close to the mean weight of the standard group of healthy children if child A is also healthy and is not undernourished. However, if child A’s weight deviates significantly farther from the mean weight of the standard group of healthy children, child A is considered to have low weight for its height and therefore considered marasmic or wasted. This deviation from the mean, also called standard deviation (SD) in statistics, is calculated for each child whose weight and height have been measured and is expressed in terms of z-scores. Therefore, the anthropometric index used for wasting is weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) and classification of level of wasting is done based on the following WHZ cut-offs: WHZ Classification WHZ &lt; -2SD Global Acute malnurition (GAM) -3SD \\(\\geq\\) WHZ &lt; -2SD Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) WHZ &lt; -3SD Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) Mid-upper arm circumference The other independent criteria for marasmus or wasting is the mid-upper arm circumference or MUAC. MUAC is a measure of muscle mass and therefore detects loss of muscle mass due to wasting. MUAC is a good predictor of mortality and in many studies, MUAC predicted death in children better than any other anthropometric indicator. Unlike weight-for-height, MUAC is used as an anthropometric index without need for standardisation. The MUAC cut-offs used to classify a child as being marasmic or wasted are: MUAC (mm) Classification MUAC &lt; 125 Global Acute malnurition (GAM) 115 \\(\\geq\\) MUAC &lt; 125 Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) MUAC &lt; 115 Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) Oedema test The final index for acute undernutrition is oedema testing for kwarshiorkor cases. This test checks whether oedema is present and whether it is bilateral and pitting. Any sign of bilateral pitting oedema, regardless of WHZ or MUAC classification, is considered severe acute malnutrition. 2.1.2 Chronic undernutrition Childhood chronic undernutrition is a condition related to a child’s exposure to inadequate nutrition over a long period of time leading to failure of linear growth. Stunted growth reflects a process of failure to reach linear growth potential as a result of suboptimal health and/or nutritional conditions. A. Physical signs and symptoms A child suffering from chronic undernutrition is also called stunting/stunted. Such a child is said to be short for its age (see below). B. Anthropometric indices Like with acute undernutrition, an index is used to classify whether a child has chronic malnutrition or not. This index is called height-for-age (HFA) or length-for-age (LFA). Given child B, this child’s length/height is assessed against the mean length/height of a standard group of children in good health with the same age as child B. Child B is expected to have a length/height close to the mean length/height of the standard group of healthy children if child B is also health and well-nourished. However, if child B’s length/height deviates significantly farther from the mean height of the standard group of healthy children, child B is considered to have low height for its age and therefore considered to be stunting or stunted. This deviation from the mean, also called standard deviation (SD) in statistics, is calculated for each child whose height has been measured and is expressed in terms of z-scores. Therefore, the anthropometric index used for stunting/stuntedness is height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) and classification of level of stunting/stuntedness is done based on the following WHZ cut-offs: HAZ Classification HAZ &lt; -2SD Global stunting/stuntedness -3SD \\(\\geq\\) HAZ &lt; -2SD Moderate stunting/stuntedness HAZ &lt; -3SD Severe stunting/stuntedness 2.2 Performing anthropometric measurements As described in this chapter, to be able to assess the anthropometric indices for acute and chronic undernutrition four (4) anthropometric measurements needs to be collected: 1) weight; 2) height; 3) mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC); and, 4) oedema. In addition to these anthropometric measurements, information on the child’s age (in months) and sex will also be needed to be able to determine the appropriate reference standards to use in calculating the child’s corresponding anthropometric indices. The next chapters provide detailed directions on how to perform the various anthropometric measurements accurately. "],
["weight.html", "Chapter 3 Measuring weight 3.1 Equipment 3.2 Personnel 3.3 Steps in weighing a child", " Chapter 3 Measuring weight 3.1 Equipment Weighing scales are the equipment needed for measuring weight. 3.1.1 Types of weighing scales Various types of scales are available to measure the weight of a child: 1) spring scales; 2) hanging scales; 2) beam balance scales; and, 3) digital scales. Spring scales are the most common type of scales used worldwide. Hanging scales are a kind of spring scale that is hung from a height instead of laid flat on the ground. Hanging scales are commonly preferred in many countries because they can be transported easily, can be used in almost any setting (particularly where a flat surface is not available) and are relatively inexpensive. However, they are not very accurate and as such are not recommended for use in nutrition surveys. Figure 3.1: Bathroom scale (spring) Figure 3.2: Hanging scale (spring) Balance beam scales are commonly used in health centers, as they need to be positioned on a flat surface for accurate measurement and are not easily transported. Figure 3.3: Balance beam scales Digital scales on the other hand are highly accurate (for as long as it is powered adequately and consistently), easily transportable though requiring a flat surface on which to be laid upon. They are generally of high quality and rugged for frequent field use as is needed for a nutrition survey. This is why digital scales are what’s currently recommended for use in anthropometric measurements in a field survey setting. In addition to being a digital scale, it is recommended to weigh children using a scale with the following features: Solidly built and durable Electronic (digital reading) Measures up to 150 kg Measures to a precision of 0.1 kg (100g) Allows tared weighing “Tared weighing” means that the scale can be re-set to zero (“tared”) with the person just weighed still on it. Thus, a mother can stand on the scale, be weighed, and the scale tared. While remaining on the scale, if she is given her child to hold, the child’s weight alone appears on the scale. Digital scales that allow for tared weighing have very clear advantages: There is no need to subtract weights to determine the child’s weight alone (reducing the risk of error). The child is likely to remain calm when held in the mother’s arms for weighing. Currently, the most commonly used digital tared weighing scale is the UNICEF Electric Scale (UNISCALE) which is produced by SECA (the non-UNICEF branded scale is the SECA model 890 or SECA model 874) Figure 3.4: SECA scale model 874 3.1.2 General use, care and maintenance of SECA tared scales Place the scale on a hard, level surface (wood, concrete, or firm earth). Soft or uneven surfaces may cause small errors in weighing. It is therefore advisable that each survey team are provided with a wooden plank that can be laid on top of unlevel ground as a way to even out the surface. The plank should be big enough to cover a reasonable surface and sturdy enough to carry the weight of the scale and those being weighed. The scale will not function correctly if it becomes too warm. It is best to use the scale in the shade, or indoors. If the scale becomes hot and does not work correctly, place it in a cooler area and wait 15 minutes before using again. The scale must adjust to changes in temperature. If the scale is moved to a new site with a different temperature, wait for 15 minutes before using the scale again. It is advisable to test the scale before every measurement when the scale is moved and operated in extreme weather conditions. The scale must be tested every single day of fieldwork. This is best done using a labelled standard weight of 2.5 - 5.0 kg. This can be purchased locally, but must be tested initially to ensure that the indicated weight is accurate. Record the results of the daily test of the scale, including the date and weight. Using other types of standard weights is possible, but is not recommended. Some surveys have in the past used filled water bottles for testing, but as water or other liquids evaporate, this technique is flawed. Sand is a viable alternative, but only if labelled weights are not available. Handle the scale carefully: Do not drop or bump the scale. Do not weigh loads with a total weight of more than 150 kg. Do not store the scale in direct sunlight or other hot places. Protect the scale against excess humidity or wetness. Do not use the scale at temperatures below 10º C or above 45º C. The scale is battery-powered. Around 120,000 weighings can be performed with a fresh set of batteries. 3.2 Personnel At least two trained personnel are required when performing weight measurement. One is assigned as the measurer while the other is assigned as the assistant. It is important that prior to the measurement of the weight of a child that these roles are clearly specified and that each personnel knows what their role entails. Switching roles between measurement of different children is acceptable for as long as all personnel are trained on performing the tasks expected of either measurer or assistant. For specific tasks for each role, see next section. 3.3 Steps in weighing a child Prepare the child for weighing Explain to parents/caretakers that the child needs to remove outer clothing in order to obtain an accurate weight. A wet diaper, or shoes and jeans, can contribute substantially to the measured weight (up to 0.5 kgs) making the measurement inaccurate. Babies should be weighed naked but precautions needs to be put in place to ensure that the baby stay warm while waiting to be weighed and while they are being weighed. They can be wrapped in a blanket to keep them warm while waiting. When being weighed, the adult can be weighed holding a blanket that can be used to wrap around the naked baby during measurement. Older children should remove all but minimal clothing, such as their underclothes. If it is too cold to undress a child or if the child resists being undressed and becomes agitated, please weigh the clothed child, but indicate in the questionnaire that the child could not be undressed to the minimum and take a note of the circumstances. Switch on scale The measurers should switch on the scale with no weight applied. The SECA 874 can be turned on by tapping the start button. The SECA 890 can be turned on by covering the solar cells for less than a second. Figure 3.5: Turning on the SECA 874 Figure 3.6: Turning on the SECA 890 When the SECA 890 is switched on, you will first notice the display showing 188.8. Wait for the display to turn 0.0 before putting any weight onto the scale. The assistant on the other hand will be holding onto the paper questionniare or the mobile device. The assistant will be in charge of recording the weight measurement. Figure 3.7: SECA 890 ready Weighing the child This step differs between children who are able to stand still on the scale long enough for a measurement to be read and recorded and children who are too young to do so. Generally, children 2 years and above should be able to stand on the scale still on their own long enough. However, it is to the discretion of the measurer whether this is the case or not. Weigh child on scale on their own If child is able to stand still on the scale long enough, the child can be weighed alone. Measurer should explain to the child that he/she will need to step on to the scale alone and standing very still. Measurer will ask the child to stand in the middle of the scale, feet slightly apart and to remain still until the weight appears and that the measurement is retained on the display (about 3 seconds that the measurement is stable with child standing still and not moving the display will stop flashing signifying that the weight display has been stored). It is important that no one holds or supports the child until a weight measurement has been retained on the display successfully as this will interfere with the measurement. If the child does not stand still or is unable or does not want to stand on his/her own, then step b below should performed instead. The measurer then reads out loud the child’s weight from the display. The measurer should read the measurement entirely including the one decimal place that shows in display. Note that when using the SECA 874, the weight is displayed with two decimal places but the second decimal number is always 0. The second decimal place is not recorded. The assistant then repeats the weight that has been called out. The measurer then confirms if this is the correct weight. If correct, then the assistant records the weight measurement on the paper questionnaire or on the mobile device. If incorrect, measurer reads out the measurement again until the assistant is able to repeat the correct weight. The child can then step off the scale. Tared weighing If child is unable to stand still on the scale long enough or if child doesn’t want to stand on the scale alone, then this child should be measured using tared weighing. The measurer asks the mother/caretaker to step onto the scale and then to stand still. After about 3 seconds, the weight of the mother/caretaker will be displayed. Figure 3.8: Weighing the adult first on the SECA 874 If using the SECA 874, the measurer will have to press the 2 in 1 key found on the scale. This will store the weight of the mother/caretaker. The display on the device would show 0.0 reading and the word NET indicating that the weight of the mother/caretaker has been stored. Figure 3.9: Taring the SECA 874 If using the SECA 890, the measurer will have to cover the solar cell of the device for less than a second and the display will revert back to 0.0 reading. This indicates that the weight of the mother/caretaker has been stored. Figure 3.10: Taring the SECA 890 The measurer then asks the mother/caretaker to hold/carry the baby/child on their arms and to again stand as still as possible. The display will show a weight measure. If the weight display and the message HOLD are flashing, it means that the scale is waiting for the measurement to stabilise. The measurer should wait for the weight display and the message HOLD to stop flashing before reading the weight measurement. Figure 3.11: SECA 874 on hold Once the weight display has stopped flashing, The measurer reads out loud the child’s weight from the display. The measurer should read the measurement entirely including the one decimal place that shows in display. Note that when using the SECA 874, the weight is displayed with two decimal places but the second decimal number is always 0. The second decimal place is not recorded. The assistant then repeats the weight that has been called out. The measurer then confirms if this is the correct weight. If correct, then the assistant records the weight measurement on the paper questionnaire or on the mobile device. If incorrect, measurer reads out the measurement again until the assistant is able to repeat the correct weight. "],
["height.html", "Chapter 4 Measuring height 4.1 Equipment 4.2 Personnel 4.3 Steps in measuring length or height of child", " Chapter 4 Measuring height 4.1 Equipment A height board, sometimes called a heightometer or stadiometer, is the tool used to measure height of children. It is usually constructed based on a ruler with a sliding horizontal headpiece which adjusts to rest on top of the head. Some common types of height boards are the wooden 2-piece and wooden 3-piece, plastic free-standing, aluminum free-standing and locally-produced boards. Of these, it is preferable to use wooden measuring boards as opposed to aluminum boards which can get very hot in the sun and burn children. The measuring board should be at least 130 cm long and made of hardwood with a hard water-resistant finish. Choice of woods is important. The board should be light enough to be easily carried in the field from house to house. The board should have two tape measures attached to it, one on each side, and they should be marked out in 0.1cm increments. The board should be easily set upright to measure height with the head piece of the length board becoming the base when the board is set upright. Figure 4.1: Vertical 2-piece height board Figure 4.2: Recumbent 2-piece height board Figure 4.3: 2-piece height board folded and carried 4.2 Personnel A minimum of two personnel are needed to measure the height or length of a child. If human resources are not an issue, a three-person team would be ideal especially when taking the length of the child. For a two-person team, one is assigned as the measurer while the other is assigned as the assistant. It is important that prior to the measurement of the height of a child that these roles are clearly specified and that each personnel knows what their role entails. Switching roles between measurement of different children is acceptable for as long as all personnel are trained on performing the tasks expected of either measurer or assistant. For specific tasks for each role, see next section. 4.3 Steps in measuring length or height of child Depending on the age of the child, either the weight or the length is measured. For children less than 24 months old (or for height less than 85 cms), length should be measured i.e., height board on recumbent position with the child lying down. For children 24 months and older, height should be measured i.e., height board on the vertical position with the child standing up. 4.3.1 Measuring height Figure 4.4: Steps in measuring height Measurer or Assistant should place the measuring board on a hard flat surface against a wall, table, tree, staircase, etc. Make sure the board is stable. Measurer or Assistant should ask the mother to remove the child’s shoes and unbraid any hair that would interfere with the height measurement. Ask mother to walk the child to the board and to kneel in front of the child. Assistant should place the paper questionnaire or mobile device on the ground (arrow 1) and kneel with both knees on the right side of the child (arrow 2). Measurer should kneel on their right knee only, for maximum mobility, on the child’s left side (arrow 3). Assistant should place the child’s feet flat and together in the centre of and against the back and base of the board. The assistant should place right hand just above the child’s ankles on the shins (arrow 4) with left hand on the child’s knees (arrow 5) and push against the board making sure the child’s legs are straight and the heels and calves are against the board (arrows 6 and 7). The assistant then notifies the measurer when positioning of the feet and legs is complete. Measurer tells the child to look straight ahead at the mother if she is in front of the child. Make sure the child’s line of sight is level with the ground (arrow 8). Measurer places open left hand on the child’s chin and gradually closes hand (arrow 9) taking care that the child’s mouth or ears are not covered. The measurer makes sure the shoulders are level (arrow 10), the hands are at the child’s side (arrow 11), and the head, shoulder blades and buttocks are against the board (arrows 12,13 and 14). With the right hand, the measurer lowers the headpiece on top of the child’s head making sure that the headpiece pushes through the child’s hair (arrow 15). Measurer and Assistant should check the child’s position (arrow 1-15) and repeating any steps necessary. When the child’s position is correct, the measurer reads and calls out the measurement to the nearest 0.1cm. Then, the measurer removes the headpiece from the child’s head and releases the left hand from the child’s chin and supports the child during the recording. Assistant immediately records the measurement and shows it to the measurer. Measurer checks the recorded measurement on the questionnaire for accuracy and legibility and instructs the assistant to erase and correct any errors. "],
