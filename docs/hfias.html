<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) is one of the experience-based food insecurity scales. Experience-based indicators are constructed from a short questionnaire that captures households’ behavioural and psychological manifestations of insecure food access, such as having to reduce the number of meals consumed or cut back on the quality of the food due to a lack of resources. HFIAS was developed in 2006 by the USAID-funded Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance II project (FANTA) in collaboration with Tufts and Cornell Universities, among other partners.</p>
</div>
<div id="hfias-questionnaire" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> HFIAS questionnaire</h2>
<p>The HFIAS uses a questionnaire of 9 items which are called <strong>occurence questions</strong> (i.e., whether condition stated in the question has happened or not) based on a 30-day recall. If condition has happened, a further question is then asked which is called a <strong>frequency-of-occurence question</strong>. The possible responses for the <strong>frequency-of-occurence</strong> are categorical - <em>rarely</em> (once or twice in the past four weeks); <em>sometimes</em> (three to ten times in the past four weeks); and <em>often</em> (more than ten times in the past four weeks).</p>
<p>The generic occurrence questions are as follows:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> HFIAS indicators</h2>
<p>Four types of indicators can be calculated to help understand the characteristics of and changes in household food insecurity in the surveyed population. These indicators are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Household Food Insecurity Access-related <strong>Conditions</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Household Food Insecurity Access-related <strong>Domains</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Household Food Insecurity Access Scale <strong>Score</strong></p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.1</span> Household Food Insecurity Access-related Conditions</h3>
<p>This indicator set consists of the responses to the individual <strong>occurence questions</strong> and <strong>frequency of occurence questions</strong>. The indicators in this set provide specific, disaggregated information about the behaviours and perceptions of the surveyed households. The indicators present the percent of households that responded affirmatively to each question, regardless of the frequency of the experience. Thus they measure the percent of households experiencing the condition at any level of severity. Each indicator can be further disaggregated to examine the frequency of experience of the condition across the surveyed households.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.2</span> Household Food Insecurity Access-related Domains</h3>
<p>The concurrence questions can be grouped into 3 domains to which they relate to with regard to food insecurity that have been found to be common across cultures. These domains are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Anxiety and uncertainty about the household food supply</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient Quality (includes variety and preferences of the type of food)</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient food intake and its physical consequences</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This indicator set on <strong>domains</strong> consists of responses to the individual <strong>occurence questions</strong> referring to each of the domains. The indicators in this set provide specific, disaggregated information about the behaviours and perceptions of the surveyed households as they pertain to the domains. The indicators present the percent of households that responded affirmatively to each question within a domain, regardless of the frequency of the experience. Thus they measure the percent of households experiencing the condition within a domain at any level of severity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.3</span> Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score</h3>
<p>The HFIAS score is a continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity (access) in the household in the past four weeks (30 days).</p>
<p>Following are the steps in calculating the HFIAS score.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Code the <strong>frequency-of-occurrence</strong> as 0 for all cases where the answer to the corresponding occurrence question was <strong>“no”</strong> (i.e., if <strong>Q1=0</strong> then <strong>Q1a=0</strong>, if <strong>Q2=0</strong> then <strong>Q2a=0</strong>, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate a HFIAS score variable is calculated for each household by summing the codes for each <strong>frequency-of-occurrence question</strong>. The maximum score for a household is 27 (the household response to all nine frequency-of-occurrence questions was “often”, coded with response code of 3); the minimum score is 0 (the household responded “no” to all occurrence questions, frequency-of-occurrence questions were skipped by the interviewer, and subsequently coded as 0 by the data analyst.) The higher the score, the more food insecurity (access) the household experienced. The lower the score, the less food insecurity (access) a household experienced.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{HFIAS Score} ~ = ~ Q1a ~ + ~ Q2a ~ + ~ Q3a ~ + ~ Q4a ~ + ~ Q5a ~ + ~ Q6a ~ + ~ Q7a ~ + ~ Q8a ~ + ~ Q9a \]</span></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next, the average Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score, is calculated using the household scores calculated above.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Average HFIAS score} ~ = ~ \frac{\sum{\text{HFIAS scores in the sample}}}{\text{Number of households sampled}} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="household-food-insecurity-access-prevalence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.4</span> Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence</h3>
<p>The final indicator is a categorical indicator of Food Insecurity Status. The Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence (HFIAP) Status indicator can be used to report household food insecurity (access) prevalence and make geographic targeting decisions.</p>
<p>Because the average HFIAS score is a continuous variable, it is more sensitive to capturing smaller increments of changes over time than the HFIAP indicator. Therefore, the HFIAP indicator should be reported in addition to, rather than instead of, the average HFIAS Score for program monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p>The HFIAP indicator categorizes households into four levels of household food insecurity (access): <strong>food secure</strong>, and <strong>mildly</strong>, <strong>moderately</strong> and <strong>severely</strong> food insecure. Households are categorized as increasingly food insecure as they respond affirmatively to more severe conditions and/or experience those conditions more frequently.</p>
<p>Following are the steps in calculating the HFIAP indicator.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The data analyst should have coded <strong>frequency-of-occurrence</strong> as 0 for all cases where the answer to the corresponding occurrence question was <strong>“no”</strong> (i.e., if <strong>Q1=0</strong> then <strong>Q1a=0</strong>, if <strong>Q2=0</strong> then <strong>Q2a=0</strong>, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate a HFIA category variable for each household by assigning a code for the food insecurity (access) category in which it falls. The four food security categories should be created sequentially, in the same order as shown below, to ensure that households are classified according to their most severe response.</p></li>
