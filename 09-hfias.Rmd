# Household Food Insecurity Access Scale {#hfias}

## Introduction
Houesehold Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) is one of the experience-based food insecurity scales. Experience-based indicators are constructed from a short questionnaire that captures householdsâ€™ behavioral and psychological manifestations of insecure food access, such as having to reduce the number of meals consumed or cut back on the quality of the food due to a lack of resources. HFIAS was developed in 2006 by the USAID-funded Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance II project (FANTA) in collaboration with Tufts and Cornell Universities, among other partners.

## HFIAS Questionnaire

The HFIAS uses a questionnaire of 9 items which are called **occurence questions** (i.e., whether condition stated in the question has happened or not) based on a 30-day recall. If condition has happened, a further question is then asked which is called a **frequency-of-occurence question**. The possible responses for the **frequency-of-occurence** are categorical - *rarely* (once or twice in the past four weeks); *sometimes* (three to ten times in the past four weeks); and *often* (more than ten times in the past four weeks).

The generic occurence questions are as follows:

+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1        | In the past four weeks, did you worry that your household would not have enough|
|          | food?                                                                          |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | In the past four weeks, were you or any household member not able to eat the   |
|          | kinds of foods you preferred because of a lack of resources?                   |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member have to eat a limited  |
|          | variety of foods due to a lack of resources?                                   |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member have to eat some foods |
|          | that you really did not want to eat because of a lack of resources to obtain   |
|          | other types of food?                                                           |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member have to eat a smaller  |
|          | meal than you felt you needed because there was not enough food?               |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member have to eat fewer meals|
|          | in a day because there was not enough food?                                    |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7        | In the past four weeks, was there ever no food to eat of any kind in your      |
|          | household because of lack of resources to get food?                            |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member go to sleep at night   |
|          | hungry because there was not enough food?                                      |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9        | In the past four weeks, did you or any household member go a whole day and     |
|          | night without eating anything because there was not enough food?               |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


The occurence questions can be grouped into 3 domains to which they relate to with regard to food insecurity that have been found to be common across cultures. These domains are:

1. Anxiety and uncertainty about the household food supply
2. Insufficient Quality (includes variety and preferences of the type of food)
3. Insufficient food intake and its physical consequences
